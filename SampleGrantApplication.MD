# Example Team Name

## Project Description
This is an **example** application for a grant programme: **Shade Grant Program: SHD TO THE MOON!**

We intend to create an insurance product on Shade Protocol. Insurance products are key for end users to derisk against smart contract and peg risk. Because Silk is an algorithmic stablecoin, there is demand for a product that hedges against the risk that Silk may lose its peg either indefinitely or for a certain duration of time. 

## Problem / Solution
Without insurance products for Shade Protocol, the primitives are incomplete as users do not have a way to hedge against their risk.

## Go-to-Market plan

## Value capture for Secret Network ecosystem
The main KPIs for Shade Protocol is TVL in insurance pools, and number of users interacting with the insurance products.

## Development Roadmap
We will require 3 months to complete this project. We intend to hav 2 developers full-time and 1 part-time, at a total cost of $X,000.

Example milestones:
* Implement X (weeks 0 - 4).
* Implement Y (weeks 4 - 8).
* Implement Z (weeks 8 - 12).

Ideally, we can receive payments in 3 disbursements, one at the beginning of the grant, one after implementation of Y and last payment when the development work is completed.

We would be willing to consider part payment in SCRTs, up to x%.
