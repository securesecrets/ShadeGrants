# Shade Grants
This is the main repository for Shade Grant proposal submissions. This README provides a high level overview of Shade Grants. Please submit all Shade Grant requests by creating a new [issue](https://github.com/securesecrets/ShadeGrants/issues). Welcome!

## Proposal Categories
Grant proposals fall primarily into four categories: **Integrations**, for everything that integrates Silk, SHD, or a Shade Protocol primitive directly; **Primitives**, for the creation of a novel or existing DeFi primitive under the Shade Protocol umbrella; and **Tooling**, for things that help developers or end users have a better experience with Shade Protocol; **Community**, for people, by people. Please consult the below list of ideas we’ve recognized to date as being of special interest to the community and essential to ongoing ecosystem growth. That said, we welcome any and all proposals and recognize that the most interesting proposals may be things the Shade community has yet to consider.

## Toolings
* **Transaction recorder** -  Shade Protocol tool that is helpful for taxes.

### Primitives
* **Insurance** to create a capital efficient insurance market for Shade Protocol DeFi risk.

### Integrations
* **Integrate Silk with Alice or a Venmo like experience**

### Community 
* **TBD**

## Grant Details
Please review the following details before applying:

### Funding amount
Funding amounts are variable and can go as high as several hundred thousand dollars, depending on the complexity and value to the network, although the average grant would likely be in the order of thousands or tens of thousands of dollars. Grants may be split into several smaller milestones and receive funding accordingly on a per-milestone basis, as mentioned below. Since this is a non-dilutive funding opportunity, we encourage commercial projects to also look for alternative sources of funding as well. We are especially interested in seeing new start-up companies and projects emerge that build exclusively on Shade Protocol. For these in particular, non-dilutive funding such as a grant would be significant.

Grant awards will be distributed in 3 or more installments, with initial payment to take place right after approval of the grant. Teams are expected to define key milestones for the project and propose installment amounts upon completion of different milestones.

### Requirements
All code must be open source. If there’s a good reason to make an exception, please specify this in your proposal, and emphasize which parts (if any) will be open source. Please mention the license you plan to use in your application.

### Who are we looking for
We are looking for individual developers, new and existing companies and projects, community members or established teams with a proven track record to contribute to the Secret Network ecosystem ecosystem. Prior work on Shade Network or experience in deploying on Cosmos chains is a plus. 

### Recommended Process
First, **ideation:** Use Shade dev discord to brainstorm, discuss ideas and form teams. We encourage you to get feedback from the community before submitting any application.

Then, **application:** When ready, submit an application via the [Grants area of the Shade GitHub repository](https://github.com/securesecrets/ShadeGrants/issues). Do this by opening a new issue in the format of [this sample application](https://github.com/ShadeFoundation/Grants/blob/main/Sample%20grant%20application).

The application should cover the following details:

* High level description of the project
* Problem / solution (max. 200 words)
* Detailed product / network improvement description (max. 500 words)
* Go-to-market and commercialization plan (if applicable)
* Team: Please share all past experiences, github links and repos
* Milestones and budget: Please provide a budget, development timelines for milestones and distribution of budget based on milestones.

If you’d instead like to apply privately, please email info@scrtlabs.com with the above information.

### Evaluation process
We will review your application and get back to you with next steps (request for more information, schedule a video interview etc.) in two weeks.
